diffutils
sdesc: "A GNU collection of diff utilities"
ldesc: "Diffutils includes four utilities: diff, cmp, diff3 and sdiff.
Diff compares two files and shows the differences, line by line.  The cmp
command shows the offset and line numbers where two files differ, or cmp can
show the characters that differ between the two files.  The diff3 command shows
the differences between three files.  Diff3 can be used when two people have
made independent changes to a common original; diff3 can produce a merged file
that contains both sets of changes and warnings about conflicts.  The sdiff
command can be used to merge two files interactively."
