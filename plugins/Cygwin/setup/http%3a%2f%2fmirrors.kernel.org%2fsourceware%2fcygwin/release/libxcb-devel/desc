sdesc: "X Protocol C-Language Bindings (core development)"
ldesc: "libxcb provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
which replaces the current Xlib interface. Xlib can also use XCB as a transport
layer, allowing software to make requests and receive responses with both,
which eases porting to XCB. However, client programs, libraries, and toolkits
will gain the most benefit from a native XCB port."
