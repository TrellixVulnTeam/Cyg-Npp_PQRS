sdesc: "GNU Internationalization runtime library"
ldesc: "The GNU gettext package provides a set of tools and documentation
for producing multi-lingual messages in programs. Tools include a set of
conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs,
a directory and file naming organization for the message catalogs, a runtime
library which supports the retrieval of translated messages, and stand-alone
programs for handling the translatable and the already translated strings.
Gettext provides an easy to use library and tools for creating, using, and
modifying natural language catalogs and is a powerful and simple method for
internationalizing programs."
